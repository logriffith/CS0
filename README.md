    -The program prints several stages of the hangman gallows.
    -It prints all stages of the game until all limbs are drawn.
    -I believe that I met all of the requirements.
    -I ran and tested the program many times.
    -VS Code says that there are no problems with my code.
    -I think that I have earned a 100% on this assignment.

## 2 - Triangle
    -The program has the user input three sides of a triangle.
    -The program has the computer calculate the area and perimeter of the triangle.
    -A test is done to verify that the three sides form a triangle.
    -I belive that I met all of the requirements.
    -I ran the program many times using different triangles that I knew.
    -I tested to make sure that the program didn't run when it shouldn't run.
    -I think that I have earned 110/100 on this assignment.
    -The assignment is in the assignments folder.

## 3 - Functions
    -The program has all 7 required functions
    -The program also has the bonus function
    -The user is asked to input two numbers
    -The functions are called and pass the entered numbers
    -I think that I have adequate descriptions to accompany the calculations
    -I have 8 assert statements, two per function
    -I think that I met all of the requirements
    -I have completed this assignment
    -I think that I have earned a 110/100 on this assignment
    -The functions folder is in the assignments folder

## 4 - Conditionals
    -The program has all of the required computational functions
    -The program has both the test function and the main function
    -The user is asked to input 5 numbers, which is in the main function
    -The test function has two assert statements per computational function
    -The main fuction is called inside of a while loop so that the user can continue to make calculations until they choose to stop
    -The calculations are done using each of the required computational functions
    -I ran it several times
    -I have met the requirements
    -I think that I have earned 110/100
    -The conditionals folder is inside the assignments folder

## 5 - Loop (Guess the Number Game)
    -I think that met all of the requirements (90 points)
    -I updated README (10 points)
    -I tested the program several times
    -I added a while loop so that the user can continue to play the game until they wish to stop. Their stats are shown at the end as well. (Bonus 10 points)
    -This assignment is finished.
    -I think that I earned 110/100.
    -The loop folder is in the assignments folder

## 6 - Avion
    -Kattis accepted my program
    -I have a function for getting the data from the user
    -I have a testable function that searches for the substring "FBI" and returns the blimps with "FBI" in the string
    -There are three test cases in a test function and all cases passed
    -A screen shot of Kattis' acceptance of my program is in the avion folder and called screenshot.png
    -program works for Kattis samples
    -Amanda Smith helped me with this assignment. 
    -This assignment is complete
    -100/100
    -Avion folder is in the assigments folder
